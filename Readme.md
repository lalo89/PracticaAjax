App currently contains:

* app.rb - the application code
* Gemfile - specifies the gems this app relies on
* Gemfile.lock - automatically generated dependancy file
* views/ - this is the default folder for erb views
* layout.erb - this is the default layout to be used for all erb files
* public/ - this is the default folder for serving static assets
* Procfile - this tells Heroku or Foreman how to run the application
* Rakefile- installs the gems and run the server
